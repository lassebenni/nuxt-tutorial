## Notes
- Added `ts-shim.d.ts` file to be able to [import components correctly](https://github.com/nuxt/typescript/issues/153).
- Created a `src` subdir and put project files in there to be able to bind them to a separate Docker volume for hot reloading.

## Questions
- How does the binding work e.g. in `AppControlInput`?
